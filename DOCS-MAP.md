## Contributing and Updating

When updating docs, maintain this structure:

- **README.md**: Keep the essence, the "why", the 10-minute overview
- **VISUAL-GUIDE.md**: Add diagrams for each stage, show progression
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Deep-dive technical details, system design
- **QUICKSTART.md**: Practical "how-to", minimal explanation
- **TESTING.md**: Validation approach, test cases
- **This file**: Update when adding new docs or reorganizing

## Questions? Start Here

| Question | Best Doc |
|----------|----------|
| What is ConfigHub? | README.md Stage 1 |
| How do I run this? | QUICKSTART.md |
| What's the architecture? | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| How does push-upgrade work? | VISUAL-GUIDE.md Stage 4 |
| How do regions scale? | VISUAL-GUIDE.md Stage 3 |
| What's lateral promotion? | VISUAL-GUIDE.md Stage 7 |
| How do I test it? | TESTING.md |
| What was tested? | TEST_REPORT.md |
| What's the project about? | PROJECT_SUMMARY.md |

---

**Bottom Line**: Start with README.md for the essence, use VISUAL-GUIDE.md to see it in action, and dive into ARCHITECTURE.md when you need the details.
